1.
The type of answer is `&str`.

2.
Because the block of code is an expression.
In Rust, programmar can assign an expression to a variable and evaluate it to a value thus it can be assigned to a variable.

3.
Blocks enclosed by `{}`.
Inside expressions, programmars can return a value, and this value will then represent the block of code and be assigned to a variable.
The syntax can be as simple as the value or return the value ended with a `;`.
