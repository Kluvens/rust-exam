1.
unsafe block explicitly tell the developers to manually manipulate memory carefully. The probability of making mistakes may be lower than C and C++.
unsafe is more flexible but in rust program, most codes are written in safe Rust. That is the codes with memory safety issues can be less than C and C++.

2.
unsafe is complicated and can be error prone for developers.
Rust is famous for its strong safety but unsafe breaks it and developers have to check it manually.
Developers need to pay more attention on the code to ensure the it is bug-free and potential bugs may not be spotted.
