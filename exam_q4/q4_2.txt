1.
Rc<T> maintains a counter, if implements Send and multiple threads can access it and modify the counter.
It could cause race conditions and inaccurate results.

2.
Without implementing Sync, multiple threads can access and update the value then cause potential risk conditions and the results may be incorrect.
Arc<T> makes the value shared across threads. And threads should be regulated to update the value inside Arc.
